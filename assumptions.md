#Assumptions

Following assumptions are made while building this application.

1.  Movies award details are first inserted into database.
2.  To maintain simplicity API key is taken as a user input.
3.  To maintain simplicity, user can insert rating directly and no formula is used to calculate rating.
4.  User can rate the same movie multiple time (duplicate) which also reflects in top rated movies.
5.  There are only few test cases written to show the knowledge of the same, but full coverage is not provided.
6.  Sorry for the UI part as I am not a frontend guy.
7.  First you have to rate at least 10 movies to show a top 10 movies, else it will show only the available onces.
